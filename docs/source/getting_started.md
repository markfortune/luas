# Getting Started

`luas` is well-documented and contains [`tutorials`](tutorials_index) which should help you get started. Information about installation and dependencies is covered in [`Installation`](installation).

As `luas` is implemented in [`jax`](https://github.com/google/jax) we would recommend getting some familiarity with `jax` if you've never used it before. ["How to Think in JAX"](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/thinking_in_jax.html) and ["JAX - The Sharp Bits"](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/Common_Gotchas_in_JAX.html) are excellent places to start.
