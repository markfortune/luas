# Getting Started

`luas` is well-documented and contains [tutorials](tutorials_index) which should help you get started. [Why Use luas?](why_use_luas) covers the computational benefits that `luas` can offer and [Luas for Exoplanets](luas_for_exo) could be helpful if applying the package to exoplanet astronomy. Information about installation and dependencies is covered in [Installation](installation).

As `luas` is implemented in [`jax`](https://github.com/google/jax), we would recommend getting some familiarity with `jax` if you've never used it before. [Things to know](things_to_know) should be a useful starting point.
